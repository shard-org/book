# Introduction

> **ðŸš¨ Shard is still deep in development, and is not usable as of the time of writing this.**

Shard is an assembly inspired programming language, focusing on:
- **Unstructured Programming** - Like in assembly the code is executed in sequence and forgetting to return will cause the program to continue executing the next instruction.
- **Freedom** - Memory, Syscalls, Registers, labels, and jumps are all exposed to the programmer. Allowing for fine grained control over the program.
- **Operator Oriented Syntax** - Most functions of the language are shortened to a single symbol, keywords and directives are all 3 characters.
- **Type Simplicity** - There's three types: struct, data, and pointer. You also aren't limited by having to cast between types, you can just use the type as if it were another. The types are there for **you** not the compiler.

## Why would I want to use shard?
Let's be honest, you probably don't.
Shard is a **small** hobby project, and is not meant to be used for anything serious.
It's meant as a language similar to assembly, but while avoiding it's gripes, making it easier to write and read.
